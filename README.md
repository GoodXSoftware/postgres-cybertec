# PostgreSQL for dummies

In this repo we document some of the postgresql issues we have encountered at GoodX Software.

Some of these may be legitimate bugs/improvements/feature incompletes. Some of these may just be us being dumb. Hopefully at least a couple fall into the first category.

## Structure

To get started we'll create a separate directory for each issue. Use this to store resources pertaining to that issue.
